// Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

// Example
// ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'

// -----------------Solution------------------
const smash = words => words.join(" ");

// Complete the solution so that it reverses all of the words within the string passed in.

// Example:

// "The greatest victory is that which requires no battle" --> "battle no requires which that is victory greatest The"

// -------------Solution---------------------
const reverseWords = (str) => str.split(" ").reverse().join(" ");
